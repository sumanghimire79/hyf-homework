npm install (to install all modules/dependencies)
npm install express (to install express module)
npm install nodemon 
npm install colors
npm install node
node
node/nodemon fileName.js
npm run dev

what is the difference ? 
node/nodemon fileName.js VS npm run dev ??

npm init (to create package.json file which is basically the meta-data (in json format) of the project)
