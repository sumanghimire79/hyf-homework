How to cook rice – basic recipe

Ingredients
* 1 cup basmati rice per serving (or weigh 75g per person)
* knob of butter or ½ tbsp oil (optional)

Instructions
1.Measure the rice into a cup and level the top, or weigh the amount of servings you want into a jug and note the liquid level it comes up to.
2.Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water until the water is clear. If you have time, soak the rice in cold water for at least 30 minutes. This will help the grains cook more evenly.
3.Pour the rice into a pan over a low heat, then add the butter or oil, if using, and stir to coat the rice grains.
4.Add double the amount of water (2 cups, or 150ml water for a 75g serving) plus some salt, if you like. To shorten the cooking time, add boiling water.
5.Bring to a boil. Swirl the rice in the pan (or stir once) to make sure it’s well distributed.
6.Put a lid on and turn the heat down to as low as possible. If you cook the rice on too high a heat, it will cook too quickly and may end up chalky in the centre.
7.Cook for 10 mins and do not take the lid off. Check the rice is cooked at the end by trying a grain. Keep cooking for another couple of mins if it isn’t quite ready, then turn the heat off.
8.Fluff the rice with a fork and serve it straightaway if you like, but if you cover it with a tea towel for 10 minutes any residual water is absorbed. You can then fluff up the grains for an even better texture.
